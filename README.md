> The all-in-one replacement for Sonarr, Radarr, Jackett... with a VPN and running in docker

Bobarr is a movies and tv shows collection manager for BitTorrent users. It uses [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to search movies and tv shows to add to your library. Then it searchs into your favorites torrent trackers the best match and downloads it for you through a VPN.

**This is an beta release!**

## Why ?

Because I was fed up to setup Radarr, Sonarr, my torrent downloader with jackett and have to switch in between all theses tools to track my downloads.

Also Sonarr and Radarr are not compatible with foreigners torrents, I had to search on my own a lot of torrents in the end and I have no time for that!

And to have something with a better ui, less configuration and faster 🚀
